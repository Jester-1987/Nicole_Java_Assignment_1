QUESTIONS
5.19 Assume that i = 1, j = 2, k = 3 and m = 2. What does each of the following statements print?
System.out.println(i == 1);
System.out.println(j == 3);
System.out.println((i >= 1) && (j < 4));
System.out.println((m <= 99) & (k < m));
System.out.println((j >= i) || (k == m));
System.out.println((k + m < j) | (3 - j >= k));
System.out.println(!(k > m));

ANSWERS
True -  1 equals 1.

False - 2 does not equal 3.

True  - 1 is greater than or equal to 1 and 2 is less than four - both sides are equal so the entire statement is true.

False - 2 is less than or equal to 99 is a true statement, but 3 is less than 2 is a false statement. Therefore,
        the entire statement is false.

True  - 2 being less than or equal to 1 is true. Even though the other half of the operand is false (3 does not equal 2), 
        the first half only needs to be true for the entire thing to be true

False - Simplifying the statement makes it 5 is less than 2 (false) or 1 is greater than or less than 3 (false). 
        Since both sides are false, the entire statment is false

False - the ! at the beginning switches the true statement (3 is less than 2) into a false one. (Or, if the statement was false,
        it would make it true.)
